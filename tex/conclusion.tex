In this paper is presented the KDM-RE which is a \textit{plug-in} on the top of the Eclipse Platform to provide support to model-driven refactoring based on ADM and uses the KDM standard. More specifically, this \textit{plug-in} supports 17 refactorings adapted to KDM. These refactorings are based on some fine-grained refactorings proposed by Fowler~\cite{refactImpro}. As stated in the case study the engineer/modernizer by using KDM-RE can apply a set refactorings in a KDM. Also, on the fly the engineer can check all changes realized in this KDM replicated into a class diagram - the engineer can visually verify the system`s changes after applying a set of refactorings. In addition, usually the source code is the only available artifact of the legacy software. 
Therefore, creating an UML class diagram makes, both the legacy software and the generated software to have a new type of artifact (i.e., UML class models), improving their documentation. %KDM-RE also supplies a multiple versions of a system at level models.

% It follows the theory of the horseshoe modernization model, which is threefold: (\textit{i}) Reverser Engineering, (\textit{ii}) Refactoring and  (\textit{iii}) Forward Engineering. 

%Firstly, the engineer starts the refactoring process by means of a KDM file or a source code to be refactored. If the engineer provides a KDM file then KDM-RE can already apply the refactorings. Otherwise, the source code of the legacy system must be transformed into PSMs. Still in the first step, these PSMs are converted into a KDM model through a set of M2M transformation by means of MoDisco. Secondly, the engineer by using KDM-RE can apply a set refactorings in this KDM. Also, on the fly the engineer can check all changes realized in this KDM replicated into a class diagram - the engineer can visually verify the system`s changes after applying a set of refactorings. KDM-RE also supplies a multiple versions of a system at level models. Finally, KDM-RE performs a forward engineering then a refactored source code is generated.

We believe that KDM-RE makes a contribution to the challenges of Software Engineering which focuses on mechanisms to support the automation of model-driven refactoring. Future work involves implementing more refactorings and conducting experiments to evaluate all refactorings provided by KDM-RE. Doing so, we hope to address a broader
audience with respect to using, maintaining, and evaluating
our tools. Currently, KDM-RE generates only class diagrams to assist the modernization engineer to perform refactorings, however, as future work, we intend to: (\textit{i}) extend this computational support to enable the achievement of other diagrams, e.g.,  the sequence diagram, (\textit{ii}) perform structural check of the software after the application of refactorings; and (\textit{iii}) carry out the assessment tool, as well as refactorings proposed by controlled experiments. %Notice that KDM-RE is open source and it can be downloaded at\textit{~www.dc.ufscar.br/$\sim$valter/KDM-RE}.
