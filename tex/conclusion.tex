In this paper is presented the KDM-RE to support the model-driven refactoring based on ADM, which uses the KDM standard. It follows the theory of the horseshoe modernization model, which is threefold: (\textit{i}) Reverser Engineering, (\textit{ii}) Refactoring and  (\textit{iii}) Forward Engineering. 

Firstly, all the artifacts of the legacy system must be transformed into PSMs by statically analyzing the legacy source code. Still in the first step, these PSMs are integrated into a KDM model through a set of M2M transformation implemented using ATL. Secondly, the engineer can apply a set refactorings in this KDM. Afterwards, KDM-RE performs a forward engineering then a new, refactored source code is generated.

We believe that KDM-RE makes a contribution to the challenges of Software Engineering which focuses on mechanisms to support the automation of software refactoring process. Long term future work involves devising more refactorings and conducting experiments to evaluate the precision and recall of all refactorings provided by KDM-RE. KDM-RE is open source and it can be downloaded at\textit{~www.dc.ufscar.br/$\sim$valter/KDM-RE}.
