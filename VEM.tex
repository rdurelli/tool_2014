\section{Background\label{sec:KDM-RE}} 

This section introduces the basic concepts of Architecture-Driven Modernization, Knowledge-Discovery Meta-model, and refactorings. 

\subsection{ADM and KDM}

OMG defined ADM initiative~\cite{1686216} which advocates carrying out the reengineering process considering MDA principles. In other words, ADM is the concept of modernizing existing systems with a focus on all aspects of the current systems architecture and the ability to transform current architectures to target architectures by using all principles of MDA~\cite{Ulrich:2010:IST:1841736}.

To perform a system modernization, ADM introduces Knowledge Discovery meta-model (KDM). KDM is an OMG specification adopted as ISO/IEC 19506 by the International Standards Organization for representing information related to existing software systems. According to P\'{e}rez-Castillo et al.,~\cite{1686216} the goal of the KDM standard is to define a meta-model to represent all the different legacy software artifacts involved in a legacy information system (e.g. source code, user interfaces, databases, etc.). The KDM provides a comprehensive high-level view of the behavior, structure and data of legacy information systems by means of a set of meta-models. The main purpose of the KDM specification is not the representation of models related strictly to the source code nature such as Unified Modeling Language (UML). While UML can be used to mainly to visualize the system ``as-is'', an ADM-based process using KDM starts from the different legacy software artifacts and builds higher-abstraction level models in a bottom-up manner through reverse engineering techniques.

As outlined before, the KDM consists of four abstraction layers: (\textit{i}) \emph{Infrastructure Layer}, (\textit{ii}) \emph{Program Elements Layer}, (\textit{iii}) \emph{Runtime Resource Layer}, and (\textit{iv}) \emph{Abstractions Layer}. Each layer is further organized into packages, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:layersKDM}. Each package defines a set of meta-model elements whose purpose is to represent a certain independent facet of knowledge related to existing software systems.  We are specially interested in the \textit{Program Elements Layer} because it defines the Code and Action packages which are widely used by our catalogue. The Code package defines a set meta-classes that represents the common elements in the source code supported by different programming languages. In Table~\ref{tab:mappingCodeToKDM} is depicted some of them. This table identifies KDM meta-classes possessing similar characteristics to the static structure of the source code. Some meta-classes can be direct mapped, such as Class from object-oriented language, which can be easily mapped to the \texttt{ClassUnit} meta-class from KDM.

\subsection{Refactoring and Model-Driven Refactoring}

In the area of object-oriented programming, refactorings are the technique of choice for improving the structure of existing code without changing its external behavior~\cite{refactImpro}. They have proved to be useful to improve the quality attributes of source code, and thus, to increase its maintainability. Nowadays, there are researches been carried out about apply refactoring in model instead of source code\cite{Ulrich:2010:IST:1841736}. Unfortunately, no catalogue of refactorings for the KDM specification exists. Nevertheless, although ADM provides the process for refactoring legacy systems by means of KDM, there is a lack of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to lead engineers to apply refactorings as such exist in others object-oriented languages. In the same direction, Model-Driven Refactoring is a special kind of model transformation that allows us to improve the structure of the model while preserving its internal quality characteristics. Model-driven refactoring is a considerably new area of research which still needs to reach the level of maturity attained by source code refactoring~\cite{ModelDrivenRefactoring}. 

Available object-oriented refactoring catalogues are not reusable as they are, because the KDM follow the MDA. This forces developers to create they own refactorings to be applied into models, i.e., they neither follow any catalogue nor use any kind of dedicated support. As a result, and due to the potential  complexity of model-driven refactoring, manual modifications into the models may lead to unwantedside-effects and result in a tedious and error-prone maintenance process. In this sense, the main contribution of this paper is the provision of an IDE to lead engineers to apply refactorings in KDM, which are based on well known refactorings\cite{refactImpro}. The IDE as well as the adapted catalogue are based on our experience as model-driven engineering. %Also, the catalogue herein provided is heavily inspired by the refactorings given by Fowler~\cite{refactImpro}.

\section{Refactoring for KDM by means of KDM-RE}\label{sec:refactoring_kdm_kdm_re}

This sections describes a \textit{plug-in} on the top of the Eclipse Platform named \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{D}iscovery \textbf{M}odel-\textbf{R}efactoring \textbf{E}nvironment (KDM-RE). 
In Figure~\ref{fig:interface} we depicted the main window of our \textit{plug-in}. 
For explanation purpose, we have identified main regions, i.e., \textcircled{a}, and \textcircled{b}.
It supports 17 refactorings adapted to KDM. These refactorings are based on some fine-grained refactorings proposed by Fowler~\cite{refactImpro}. All the adapted refactorings are shown in Table~\ref{tab:adaptedRefactoring}. We chose the Fowler's refactorings once them are well known, basic and fine-grained refactorings. Please, not that KDM-RE uses MoDisco\footnote{\url{http://www.eclipse.org/MoDisco/}} once it provides an extensible framework to transform an specific source-code to KDM models.

\end{figure}
 
%Thus, suppose that a KDM model has already been instantiated. 
%All the steps to how obtain a KDM instance are explained further. 
%In order to assist the refactorings we extended the KDM's model browser provided by MoDisco. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:interface} is presented just a snippet of KDM-RE. Starting from the popup menu named ``Refactoring KDM'', in this model browser, see Figure~\ref{fig:interface}\textcircled{a}, either the software developer or software modernizer can interact with the KDM model and choose which refactoring must be carried out in the KDM.
%
%We added a popup menu named ``Refactoring KDM'' in this model browser, see Figure~\ref{fig:interface}\textcircled{a}.
%By using this menu the engineer can interact with the KDM model and choose which refactoring must be carried out in the KDM.
In the region \textcircled{a} can be seen all 17 refactorings that have been implemented in KDM-RE. 
For illustration purposes only we drew rectangles to separate the refactorings into three groups. 
The black rectangle represents refactorings that deal with generalization, the blue rectangle stand for refactorings to organize data and the red one symbolize refactoring to assist the moving features between objects.


The region \textcircled{b} on Figure~\ref{fig:interface} shows an UML class diagram that can be used before to apply some refactorings in order to assist the engineer to decide where to apply the refactorings. This UML class diagram also can be useful as the engineer performs the refactorings in KDM model, i.e., changes are reproduced on the fly in a class diagram.
We claim that the latter use of this UML class diagram is important once it provides an abstract view of the system, hence, the engineer/modernizer can visually check the system's changes after applying a set of refactorings. 
In addition, in the context of modernization of a legacy system usually the source-code is the only available artifact of that legacy system. 
Therefore, creating an UML class diagram makes, both the legacy system and the generated software to have a new type of artifact (i.e., UML class models), improving their documentation.

%KDM-RE also supplies a multiple versions of a system at level models (KDM) which allows the engineer to work interactively on multiple models and to explore alternate refactoring path. As can see in the region \textcircled{c} (see Figure~\ref{fig:interface}), the engineer must select a KDM file, then he must right-click on the mouse to appear a popup menu named ``Versions''. By releasing the mouse on this menu, three options is shown: (\textit{i}) List of changes, (\textit{ii}) Delete version and (\textit{iii}) Create a child version. The last option create a copy of the KDM file - then the engineer can explore another refactoring path. The second option delete a specific version - first option shows all changes that have been realized in a current KDM file, all changes are depicted in an Eclipse View, as shown in region \textcircled{d}. In this View it is possible to visualize the author that have committed the changes, the project and all refactorings realized.

\subsection{Case Study}

In this section, we motivate KDM-RE by analyzing an example. This example is a small part of the university domain.  Figure~\ref{fig:interface}~\textcircled{b} (left side) shows a class diagram used for modeling a small part of the
university domain. In an university there are several Persons, more specifically Professors, their Assistants, and Students. Each Person has RG, CPF, and address (of type String). Moreover, classes Professor, Assistant, and Student have an attribute name of type String each. Pretend that either the software modernizer or the software developer found out by looking at the UML class diagram (see Figure~\ref{fig:interface}\textcircled{b} left side) this redundantly, i.e., equal attributes in sibling classes. Therefore, he/she must apply the refactoring ``Pull Up Field'. Similarly, he/she also found out by looking at the UML class diagram that one class is doing work that should be done by two or more. For example, he/she found that the attributes RG and CPF should be modularized to a class. Similarly, it is necessary to provide more information about they address, such as number, city, country, etc. Therefore, he/she must apply the refactoring ``Extract Class'' to the attributes ``RG'', ``CPF'' and ``rua''. Due space limitation it is depicted just the extraction of the attributes ``RG'' and ``CPF''.  The first step is to select the meta-class that he/she identified as a bad smell, i.e., the meta-class to be extracted into a separate one.  This step is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:wizard}(a). 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
  % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figure/Wizard2}
\caption{Extract Class Wizard}
\label{fig:wizard}
\end{figure}

After selecting the meta-class, a right-click opens the context menu where the refactoring is accessible. After the click, the system displays the ``RefactoringWizard'' to the engineer, Figure~\ref{fig:wizard}(b) depicts the Extract Class Wizard. In this wizard, the name of the new meta-class can be set. Also a preview of all detected \texttt{StorableUnits} and \texttt{MethodUnits} that can be chosen to put into the new meta-class. Further, the engineer can select if either the new meta-class will be a top level meta-class or a nested meta-class. The engineer also can select if the KDM-RE must create instances of \texttt{MethodUnits} to represent accessors methods (gets and sets). Finally, the engineer can set the name of the \texttt{StorableUnit} that represent the link between the two meta-classes (the old meta-class and the new one). After all of the required inputs have been made, the engineer can click on the button ``Finish'' and the refactoring ``Extract Class'' is performed by KDM-RE. 

As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:wizard}(c) a new instance of \texttt{ClassUnit} named ``Document'' was created - two \texttt{StorableUnit} from ``Pessoa'', i.e., ``rg'' and ``CPF'' were moved to the new \texttt{ClassUnit} - instances of \texttt{MethodUnits} were also created to represent the gets and sets. In addition, the instance of \texttt{ClassUnit} named ``Pessoa'' owns a new instance of \texttt{StorableUnit} that represent the link between both \texttt{ClassUnits}. Due space limitation the other \texttt{StorableUnits} of \texttt{ClassUnit} named ``Pessoa'' are not shown in Figure~\ref{fig:wizard}(c). After the engineer realize the refactorings, an UML class diagram is created on the fly to mirror graphically all changes performed in the KDM model, see Figure~\ref{fig:interface}\textcircled{b} right side. %Moreover, the KDM-RE creates/updates a tracking log to show the historic of all changes performed in the system, as can be see in Figure~\ref{fig:interface}\textcircled{d}.
